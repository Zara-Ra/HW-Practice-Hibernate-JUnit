We can implement Hibernate Configurations without a cfg.xml file,by importing java.util.Properties and assigning the
values for each property, these properties are all present in the xml file such as:
hibernate.connection.url
dialect
hbm2ddl.auto
show_sql
We assign the desired values to these properties, make a new Configuration and add these properties to it, and then we
have to add the annotated classes we have defined as @Entity in our model. by this call a new SessionFactory is created
and can be used to open Sessions in the program.
The code for the above explanations is available in q1.model.repository.DBConfig
Thanks to Hibernate! Happy Programming!
