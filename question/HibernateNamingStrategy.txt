Logical name is the name that is stored in java / hibernate
Physical name is the name in the database
There are to phases for naming, so two different teams with different concerns( object modeling and database) don't have
conflicts in naming, and can use their specific naming strategies like camelCase for object-oriented modeling and sneak_case
for database table and column naming.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Logical Naming Strategy

    -explicit naming strategy
        we can use @Table @Column annotations to rename the table and column names explicitly

    -implicit naming strategy
        by adding a property tag to cfg and mentioning which implicit strategy to use for logical names
        <property name="hibernate.implicit_naming_strategy" value="jpa" />

        types of implicit naming: default,jpa,legacy-hbm,legacy-jpa,component-path
        jpa:The logical name of an entity class is either the name provided in the @Entity annotation or the unqualified class name
        if you use @Entity(name = "MyName") the MyName should be used in the HQL or JPQL queries
        but if you don't mention a name in @Entity by default the class name is used.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Physical Naming Strategy

    by default the physical name will be the same as the logical name

    -CamelCaseToUnderscoresNamingStrategy in Hibernate 5.5.4
        by adding a property to hibernate cfg we can use this strategy,which changes all camelCase names to all lower-case
        and containing underscores
        <property name="hibernate.physical_naming_strategy"
            value="org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.CamelCaseToUnderscoresNamingStrategy"/>

    -Implementing a custom physical naming strategy
        by implementing the PhysicalNamingStrategy interface or
        extending Hibernateâ€™s PhysicalNamingStrategyStandardImpl class
        and adding a property tag in cfg addressing the custom implemented class
